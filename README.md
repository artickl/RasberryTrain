Christmas train via Google Info: Rasberry Pi Zero (because I have it) Walmart Christmas Train

Idea: start/stop train via "Ok Google, Christmas is coming! / Crhistmas is over"

Benefits: work with Rasberry Wifi, Setup, GPIO, 5V Relay, may be some extra lights get pyton involved (local GPIO management) get node.js involved (web app) IFTTT with Google Assistant PS: another idea to prevent port forwarding for web is to use Telegram to make communication like: Google Assistant -> IFTTT -> Telegram -> Rasberry Pi the benefit of it, it can work at any time regardless where train is located, just need to connect wifi
